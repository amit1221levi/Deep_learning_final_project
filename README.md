Introduction

In this assignment we'll explore deep reinforcement learning. We'll implement two popular and related methods for directly learning the policy of an agent for playing a simple video game.

General Guidelines

Please read the getting started page on the course website. It explains how to setup, run and submit the assignment.
This assignment requires running on GPU-enabled hardware. Please read the course servers usage guide. It explains how to use and run your code on the course servers to benefit from training with GPUs.
The text and code cells in these notebooks are intended to guide you through the assignment and help you verify your solutions. The notebooks do not need to be edited at all (unless explicitly specified). The only exception is to fill your name(s) in the above cell before submission. Please do not remove sections or change the order of any cells.
All your code (and even answers to questions) should be written in the files within the python package corresponding the assignment number (hw1, hw2, etc). You can of course use any editor or IDE to work on these files.
